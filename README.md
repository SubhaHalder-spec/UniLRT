# UniLRT
Testing against umbrella-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA Code is for testing equality means against umbrella-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA. We have considered Likelihood ratio test of H_0:mu_1 = mu_2 = ... = mu_k vs. H_1:mu_1 <= mu_2<=....<= mu_h >=....>= mu_k (at least one strict inequality), where mu_i represent the population means of different treatments. The input has two variables: a sample_data list and a significance_level. The output includes the critical value, the UniLRT test statistic value, and the result, indicating whether the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the value of the UniLRT statistic is less than the critical value, we will reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we will not reject it.
